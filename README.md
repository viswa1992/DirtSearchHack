# Reality Check - A platform for spotting misinformation
We are from the Microsoft DIRT team - our team maintains gathers and maintains a repository of all the emerging misinformation themes on the internet.
In this hack we have leveraged this repository as well as Bing search data to build a platform that is able to verify if any given text is factually correct.

## Try it out: Edge plugin
To demonstrate the power of this platform we have built a plugin for edge browser:
1. #### Download the edge plugin zip from here: https://github.com/viswa1992/DirtSearchHack/blob/main/Extension/Download/DirtRealityCheckProd.zip </br> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/833cf1ec-b0ce-41d6-9530-4deb3e381f35" alt="ExtensionSettings" width="400"/>
1. #### Open your edge browser and go to the extension settings: </br> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abd374cb-de06-482d-8aaf-24a89ee17b6e" alt="ExtensionSettings" width="400"/>
1. #### Enable developer mode: </br> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ad1dad6-6596-4411-b3bd-7b7b0f6677e1" alt="ExtensionSettings" width="400"/>
1. #### Drag and drop the downloaded zip file anywhere into this window (no need to extract): </br> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e300b872-03f0-4e0f-9c6f-a6ace2cf9b98" alt="ExtensionSettings" width="400"/>
1. #### Visit any page, for ex: https://www.rt.com/
1. #### Highlight any text that you would like to fact check, right click and Reality Check!!:  </br> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e2d9ddc-8067-4488-8cc4-5958a850edd0" alt="ExtensionSettings" width="1000"/>
1. #### As we are operating with a "shared" GPT service, results might take some time, please wait for the results.
